# Qt-Based FFmpeg GUI for easy video editing

features I want to implement:
- easy video trimming
- easy video cropping and rescaling
- seamless video encoding conversion

Currently in progress.

To run:
```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

Make sure you have qt and ffmpeg installed respectively
